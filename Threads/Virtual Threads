/*
 * Virtual threads are lightweight threads introduced in Java 19+ (part of
 * Project Loom).
 * 
 * 🔹 What they are
 * 
 * They’re like normal threads but managed by the JVM, not the OS — meaning
 * thousands can run with very low memory use.
 * 
 * 🔹 Key points
 * 
 * Created with Thread.ofVirtual().
 * 
 * Use much less memory than platform threads.
 * 
 * Great for handling many concurrent tasks (like servers).
 * 
 * Very cheap to create.
 * 
 * Automatically parked when blocked (no CPU waste).
 * 
 * Same API as normal threads.
 * 
 * 👉 Use them for high concurrency (e.g., web servers, async tasks).
